Hello to whoever gets to check this project out! 

A few things to note: 

1: If you are not running this on an actual device (or a M1 mac running the simulator), the map screen and maps on the table view may have a slight lag (I only experienced this with the iOS 12 SIMULATOR). However, this is not the case on actual device it simply happens because of the emulation layer. For the best experience I recommend changing the team in the project settings and running it on an actual iPhone or iPad. 

2: I tried to keep a linear history of everything I did. This means you can trace back the project merge by merge easily to see how things were added and changed during the entire development process.

3: I used a little bit of git issues for both keeping track of what I did and extras I added.

4: Of course, there is a unit test for the API

I hope you enjoy :)
